## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Hi all, assignment 6 is finally complete. Now I am going to reflect on the challenges I had and the things I learned. apicalls.py was difficult for me because I had many code errors where my cache was unable to communicate with the path it was supposedly pulling from. After meeting with Anegla, I learned that I need to focus on functions and caling my programs so that I can test them. 

I found myself writing either programs without actually testig them and then finding a ton of errors. This is something I want to work on before the end of the semester and my final project. 

Some of mycode in apicall.py was not being linked through my API Key that was provided to me. I was able to use the site where I can test the API Key to my advantage. I did this by making sure that my key was wokring and running before I reimplimented it into the code for testing. While the logic of this assignment was not confusing, I do believe there are manyt things that I still lack the understanding of in this code. I am working to better understand dictionaries. Copilot wrote a bit of this program for me which led me to be more confused, but with some explanation from professor I can understand dictionaries. 

I also had some issues with my testing navigation that made this aasignment take longer than I wanted it to. It would not load and that was a VS Code issue.
